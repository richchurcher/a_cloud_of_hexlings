# Bevy Jam 4 Design Document

## Elevator pitch

You are a hexagon. You spawn many child-hexes. These are your drones. You are helpless without them.
They are helpless without you. Together, you must survive the hostile geometric darkness in which
you find yourself.

## Inspiration

### Homeworld

Love those fighters drawing paths through the void with their drive plumes.

### Factorio

Bots are an intrinsic part of the mid to late game. A cloud of bots surrounds you, travelling away
from you and toward you, completing tasks.

### Assassin's Creed: Origins

Bayek and Senu's symbiotic relationship adds a wonderful dimension. Importantly, she is his eyes and
ears, but can also engage his foes. She dispells the fog of war and acts as his advance scout.
