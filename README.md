# Bevy Jam 4 Design Document

## Elevator pitch

You are a hexagon. You spawn many hexlings. These are your drones. You are helpless without them.
They are helpless without you. Together, you must survive the hostile geometric darkness in which
you find yourself.

## Inspiration

### Homeworld

Love those fighters drawing paths through the void with their drive plumes.

### Factorio

Bots are an intrinsic part of the mid to late game. A cloud of bots surrounds you, travelling away
from you and toward you, completing tasks.

### Assassin's Creed: Origins

Bayek and Senu's symbiotic relationship adds a wonderful dimension. Importantly, she is his eyes and
ears, but can also engage his foes. She dispells the fog of war and acts as his advance scout.

### Starcraft 2


Carriers are just fun to play. They take a long time to build up to full strength, but are
devastating to certain enemy types.

## Player experience

In a roguelike style, the player moves through "rooms" in an uncertain environment, obscured by fog
of war. They must depend on their growing relationship with their spawned hexlings, learning more about them and their capabilities as they progress.

## Platform

Web (WASM), Linux, Windows, MacOS.

## Development software

- **Bevy Engine**: rendering/ECS/etc
- **Neovim**: code and debugging
- **Bitwig Studio**: music and effects
- TODO: credit crates

## Genre

Story-driven roguelike.

## Target audience

People who like an off-beat concept, and who appreciate story provided alongside their mayhem might
enjoy this game. Also, geometry.

## Concept

### Gameplay overview

Initially, the player spawns a single, tiny hexling. They discover they are entirely dependent on it
to survive. In turn, it must be "fed" raw materials. It follows the player, and can be sent forth at
a distance or recalled to "home base".
